excerpt: 'Driven by the increasing use of mobile phone’s user, major telecommunication providers deploy more base stations to cover a wider geographic area. However, that leads to soaring energy consumption. The primary contribution of this paper is to propose a visual analytics approach to enhance energy awareness for cellular network planning. With the goal of increasing energy efficiency and maintaining the quality of service, we present a map-based visual analysis tool called Aureole for the exploration and analysis of cellular networks in spatial and temporal aspects. Moreover, it was designed with circular composition theory to allow users to concentrate on the area of interest while not losing the context information. With this method, users can conduct a multi-level analysis of the cellular network. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the approach in a set of usage scenarios.'
