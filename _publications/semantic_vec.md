excerpt: 'The cellular base stations (BSs) deployed by the mobile operator kept recording the activities of the mobile phone. Phone user’s activity records contain the movement behavior of users and related BSs’ semantics. Aiming at the difficult of accessing BS semantics and activity patterns of mobile users in cities, a visual analysis method is proposed. It helps analysts exploring the potential patterns of users and help analysts understand the mobile patterns in urban. First, BS sequences are created for each mobile user according to their trajectory to obtain the semantic of each BS by word embedding technique and identify user’s behavior patterns by clustering technology. Based on the user trajectory and BS semantics, an urban mobile pattern visual analysis system is built to help analysts detecting and understanding the urban mobile patterns with mobile user BS trajectories. Finally, the real data-based experiment shows that our method is effective in identifying user behavior patterns and activity patterns of an urban with user iterative interactions.'
