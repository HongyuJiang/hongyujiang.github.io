excerpt: "
In recent years, many studies have explored endowing chatbots with personality comprising various human-like characteristics, such as personal traits and emotional behavior. From these studies an area of research has emerged focusing on enabling chatbots to even perform in a human-like fashion as an individual-like conversational agent. As yet, however, no survey paper has sufficiently reviewed these various studies on personality-related chatbots. Therefore, this article sets out to be the  first survey to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the history, the state-of-the-art, and potential trends in this emerging field. We offer a unified definition and a layered model of personality to the rich personal characteristics that can be endowed on chatbots' personalities. We further propose the term of Personality-Aware Chatbot (PAC) to unify the various terms used to taxonomize chatbots with personality. We have further sub-divided all PACs in this survey into two basic categories, i.e., the Self-Personality-Aware Chatbot (SPAC), which has its own personality, and the Other Personality-Aware Chatbot (OPAC) that adapts to a specific user's personality. Then, we review the details of SPACs and OPACs as well as their concrete personalities, functions and applications in existing studies. Moreover, a general PAC framework is proposed to set out four kinds of personality embedding techniques, namely personality regulation, correlation, constraint and adjustment. In addition, this article also reviews available personality-labeled corpora and evaluation approaches used in current PACs, and discusses technical challenges and potential applications of future PACs."
