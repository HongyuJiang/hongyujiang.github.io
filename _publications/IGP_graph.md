excerpt: "In recent years, the drawing of dynamic graphs has been a difficulty in the field of visualization. In this paper, we propose a novel visualization method to draw dynamic graphs. For dynamic graphs, the initial location of new nodes is especially important. Therefore, we use a variant of the SSBM (Sorted Sequential Barycenter Merging) algorithm to determine the initial position of the newly added nodes. In this process, when adding an additional edge, in order to ensure the beauty of the graph, we use the AER (Additional Edge Resizing) algorithm to readjust the size of the edge. In addition, in the update process of dynamic graphs, we introduce the concept of 'grade'. We use 'grade' to ensure the stability of the graph structure. In order to simplify the calculation of the repulsive forces of the nodes in the updating process, we partition the nodes and proposed to calculate the repulsive force in the form of pseudo-nodes. The experiments show that our method has high performance and good layout effect."
