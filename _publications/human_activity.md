excerpt: "Mobile data imply various information, including spatiotemporal characteristics and the social relations of human activities, which have great value for human behavior exploration. In order to analyze and understand the activities of mobile users, a mobile data visual analytics framework is proposed focusing on users activity understanding based on the spatiotemporal and social features of mobile data. And, a visual analytic system for mobile data is also built, which aims to explore mobile users behavior patterns in the different period, detect their social roles and discover the real social relations. It has been examined with mobile data in a city, and the results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method."
